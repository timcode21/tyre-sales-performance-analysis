# Tyre Sales Performance & Product Demand Analysis  
Excel & Power BI | Sales Analytics | Inventory Insights

# 1. Background and Overview
This project analyzes six months of anonymized sales data from a tyre retail and service business.
The objective was to move beyond raw transaction records and answer practical business questions:
a. Which months drive the highest revenue?
b. Which products and tyre sizes generate the most demand?
c. What price segments contribute most to overall sales?
b. Where should inventory focus to reduce stock risk?

The goal of this analysis is to support better inventory planning, product prioritization, and revenue optimization decisions.
